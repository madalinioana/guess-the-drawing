   ## 1. User Stories

### Backend
1. **Enter App:**  
   As a user, I want to choose a unique nickname to join the game so that I can participate in drawing and guessing.

2. **Room Management:**  
   As a user, I want to create a new room or join an existing one (by room code) so that I can play with friends or random opponents.

3. **Word Assignment:**  
   As a user, I want the server to assign a random word to the current drawer each round so that the game proceeds automatically.

4. **Real-Time Drawing Broadcast:**  
   As a user, I want my drawing strokes to be sent to the server and broadcast to all connected clients in the room so that everyone sees the same sketch in real time.

5. **Chat & Guessing:**  
   As a user, I want to send chat messages or guess attempts; the server should check guesses against the assigned word and award points when correct.

6. **Scoring & Ranking:**  
   As a user, I want the server to track all players‚Äô points and update the room leaderboard so that I can see who‚Äôs winning each round.

### Frontend
7. **Drawing Tools:**  
   As a user, I want an intuitive set of drawing tools (brush size, colors, eraser) so that I can sketch clearly.

8. **Live Canvas Rendering:**  
   As a user, I want the canvas to update immediately as others draw so that I can guess in real time without delay.

9. **Responsive Design:**  
   As a user, I want the app to adapt to different screen sizes so that I can play on desktop or mobile seamlessly.

10. **Clean Interface:**  
    As a user, I want a minimal, intuitive UI with clear indicators (whose turn it is, timer countdown, current score) so that I can focus on drawing and guessing.

## 3. UML Diagram

![UML_diagram](images/umDiagrama.png)

Below is a concise, plain-language overview of the UML diagram shown above:

1. **Overall Layout**  
   - The diagram is split into two halves: **Backend (left)** and **Frontend (right)**.  
   - Both halves live inside a single bounding box labeled with their technology stacks (Node/Express/Socket.io on the left; React/Vite/Socket.io Client on the right).

2. **Backend Section**  
   - **GameServer** sits at the top: it listens on a network port, handles incoming Socket.io connections, and exposes methods such as `start(port)`, `createRoom(roomId, host)`, `joinRoom(roomId, player)`, `leaveRoom(roomId, player)`, and `broadcastToRoom(roomId, event, data)`.  
   - **GameRoom** is the core ‚Äúroom‚Äù object:  
     - **Attributes:**  
       - `roomId` (unique primary key)  
       - `players: List<Player>` (all participants)  
       - `drawer: Player` (the player currently drawing)  
       - `currentWord: String` (word to be drawn)  
       - `roundInProgress: boolean` (tracks if a round is active)  
       - `timer: Timer` (manages the countdown)  
     - **Methods:**  
       - `addPlayer(p: Player)` / `removePlayer(p: Player)`  
       - `startRound()` / `endRound()` / `nextDrawer()`  
       - `receiveDrawing(data: DrawingData)` (processes pencil strokes)  
       - `receiveGuess(player: Player, guess: String)` (checks chat guesses)  
       - `calculateScores()`  
     - Represents a single game room: it holds state for players, the current drawer, the current word, and round timing.  
   - **Player** represents one connected user:  
     - **Attributes:**  
       - `socketId: String` (primary key)  
       - `username: String`  
       - `score: int`  
       - `isHost: boolean` (true if this player created the room)  
       - `roomId: String` (foreign key to GameRoom)  
     - **Methods:**  
       - `send(event: String, data: Object)` (emit a socket event)  
       - `updateScore(points: int)` (adjust the player‚Äôs score)  
   - **ChatMessage** models each text message sent in a room:  
     - **Attributes:**  
       - `messageId: String` (primary key)  
       - `roomId: String` (foreign key)  
       - `senderId: String` (foreign key to Player)  
       - `text: String`  
       - `timestamp: Date`  
     - Represents a single chat entry.  
   - **DrawingData** encapsulates every drawing stroke:  
     - **Attributes:**  
       - `drawingId: String` (primary key)  
       - `roomId: String` (foreign key)  
       - `playerId: String` (foreign key to Player)  
       - `x: float` / `y: float` (coordinates)  
       - `color: String`  
       - `thickness: int`  
       - `tool: String` (e.g., ‚Äúbrush‚Äù or ‚Äúeraser‚Äù)  
     - When the drawer moves their mouse, the client builds a DrawingData object and sends it to the server, which relays it to all other clients in that room.

3. **Frontend Section**

       - `drawerId: String` (which player is currently drawing)  
       - `currentWord: String` (hidden from guessers)  
       - `timeLeft: number` (remaining seconds in the current round)  
     - **Methods:**

       - `sendChat(text: String): void` (emit a chat/guess event)  
       - `sendDrawing(data: DrawingData): void` (emit stroke data)  
       - `render(): JSX.Element`  
     - Displays chat, drawing canvas, player list (leaderboard), and timer.  
   - **Chat** displays a scrolling list of `ChatMessageClient[]` objects, each with `sender`, `text`, and `timestamp`.  
   - **DrawingCanvas** is the interactive drawing area:  
     - **Attributes:**  
       - `isDrawer: boolean` (true if this client is the current drawer)  
       - `color: String` / `thickness: number` (brush settings)  
     - **Methods:**  
       - `onMouseDown(e: MouseEvent): void` / `onMouseMove(e: MouseEvent): void` / `onMouseUp(e: MouseEvent): void` (gather and emit DrawingData)  
       - `clearCanvas(): void` (reset the canvas at round start/end)  
       - `render(): JSX.Element`  
   - **Leaderboard** shows a list of `PlayerClient[]`, each with `id`, `username`, and `score`, highlighting the drawer.  
   - **Timer** displays the countdown (`timeLeft: number`) and has methods `startCountdown(duration: number)` and `stopCountdown()`.  
   - **PlayerClient** (client-side model):  
     - `id: String`  
     - `username: String`  
     - `score: number`  
   - **ChatMessageClient** (client-side model):  
     - `sender: String`  
     - `text: String`  
     - `timestamp: String`

4. **Key Relationships & Data Flow**  
   1. **Server ‚Üí Room Management**  
      - Clients emit `createRoom` or `joinRoom` to **GameServer**, which creates/returns a **GameRoom**.  
      - **GameRoom** holds its `players`, the current `drawer`, and a **Timer**.  
      - When a round starts, **GameRoom** selects a `currentWord`, sets `roundInProgress = true`, and starts the **Timer**.

   2. **Drawing Broadcast**  
      - The drawer‚Äôs client calls `onMouseMove` in **DrawingCanvas**, emitting `drawing` events matching **DrawingData** to **GameServer**.  
      - **GameServer** calls `broadcastToRoom(roomId, 'drawing', data)`. Each client‚Äôs **DrawingCanvas** receives that data and renders the stroke immediately.

   3. **Chat & Guess Processing**  
      - All clients send chat messages via `sendChat(text)` in **Room**, emitting a `guessAttempt` event to **GameServer**.  
      - **GameServer** runs `receiveGuess(player, guess)`. If correct, it updates that **Player**‚Äôs score and broadcasts a ‚Äúcorrect guess‚Äù event.  
      - The **Leaderboard** updates by broadcasting an updated `players` list to all clients.

   4. **Round Transition**  
      - When the **Timer** in **GameRoom** expires or everyone guesses correctly, **GameRoom** calls `endRound()`, updates scores, picks a new drawer with `nextDrawer()`, chooses a new `currentWord`, and resets the **Timer**.  
      - Clients receive a `newRound` event, which triggers **DrawingCanvas.clearCanvas()**, **Timer.startCountdown()**, and updates the drawer highlight in **Leaderboard**.

   5. **Client State Models**  
      - **PlayerClient** and **ChatMessageClient** mirror server-side **Player** and **ChatMessage** but use client-friendly types (e.g., timestamp as a string).  
      - **DrawingData** on the client matches exactly what the server expects for real-time stroke broadcasting.


## 6. Unit Test Automation

**Status:** In progress  

Tests are written using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) (frontend) and [Mocha & Chai](https://mochajs.org/ + https://www.chaijs.com/) (backend).

- **Backend Tests (Mocha & Chai):**  
  - `RoomService`  
    - `createRoom()`  
    - `joinRoom()`  
    - `assignWord()`  
  - `ScoreService`  
    - `calculatePoints()`  
    - `updateLeaderboard()`  
  - `WordBank`  
    - `getRandomWord()`  
    - `validateCustomWordList()`  

- **Frontend Tests (Jasmine):**  
  - `DrawingComponent`  
    - should emit stroke data on draw  
    - should clear canvas at round end  
  - `ChatComponent`  
    - should send chat message on Enter  
    - should not allow empty guesses  
  - `LobbyComponent`  
    - should create a new room via API  
    - should navigate to room on successful join
